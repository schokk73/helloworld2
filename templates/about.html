<!-- Introduction -->
<h2> Who am I?</h2>
<p> I am a second-year student at the University of Maryland, College Park, studying Aerospace Engineering. In addition to my studies, I'm part of multiple organizations and programs on campus, such as Theta Tau (Professional Co-ed Engineering Fraternity) and the QUEST Honors Program. In my free time, I like to work out, travel, listen to music, play sports (primarily basketball and spikeball), and hang out with my friends.</p>
<h2> What is The Purpose of This Page?</h2>
<p> This semester, I am taking a QUEST elective titled "Quality Web Development in Business," where we are learning about some of the basics of web development in order to create a webpage for a client. I've had some previous coding experience through my engineering classes, but this the first time I'm doing more web-focused coding. We just started to learn how to use HTML, therefore I'm making this page to showcase my HTML skills.</p>
